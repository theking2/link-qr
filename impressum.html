<h1>IMPRESSUM</h1>
<h2>go321</h2>
<h3>who are we</h3>
<p><span class="go321">go321</span> is independent and we do not collect any data on you, we couldn´t care less.</p>
<h3>hHow this works</h3>
<p>We do store your email and password if you sign up. We do store the links you create. That what this is basically.
  We do not care what links and the content is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Some log files are created and deleted after three months. </p>
<p>Our service will be free and online as far we can control it. Short links will not be reused and will be available as long as we exist.</p>
<h3>Why we are here</h3>
<p>As we believe in free stuff, there are no creepy third patry trackers here. We don´t collect data other than the short codes and the url and the number of times a link was used.</p>
<p>We don´t care what you store and are not responsible for links you have stored here. We might have to disclose to law inforcement your email if you store somehing dodgy and disable the link.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>contact me on theking2.king.ma if something extraodinarily is going on.</p>
<p>BTW links might be removed if someone does not like them. You will not be notified of this, but the short code will not be reused.</p>
